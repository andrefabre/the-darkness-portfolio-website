                                <h4>The Problem</h4>
                                <p>A Perth-based consulting firm was concerned about their external digital footprint after hearing about recent cyberattacks on similar businesses. They needed to understand what information about their company was publicly accessible and whether their email systems were properly secured against common attack vectors.</p>
                            </div>
                            
                            <div class="process">
                                <h4>Our Process</h4>
                                <p>We conducted a comprehensive external perimeter assessment, analyzing their DNS configuration, email security protocols (SPF, DKIM, DMARC), and publicly available information. Using the same reconnaissance techniques that attackers employ, we mapped their digital footprint and identified potential entry points that could be exploited.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>The Outcome</h4>
                                <p>The assessment revealed three critical vulnerabilities: misconfigured email authentication records, an outdated web application, and exposed employee information on social media. We provided a prioritized action plan with specific implementation steps. Within two weeks, the client had secured their email systems, updated their web presence, and implemented a social media policy. The business now has confidence in their external security posture and a clear process for ongoing monitoring.</p>

                            <strong>Key Insight:</strong> Most businesses don't realize how much information they're unknowingly sharing with potential attackers. A systematic external assessment reveals these blind spots before they become security incidents.

                                <h4>The Challenge</h4>
                                <p>A family of four was concerned about identity theft after friends experienced online scams. They wanted to understand what personal information was publicly available and how to better protect themselves from increasingly sophisticated cybercriminals targeting Australian families.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                                <p>We conducted a comprehensive digital footprint analysis for each family member, checking for exposed personal information, compromised passwords in data breaches, and vulnerable social media settings. We also assessed their home network security and online banking practices.</p>
                            </div>

                                <h4>The Results</h4>
                                <p>The audit uncovered that family members' passwords had appeared in multiple data breaches, their social media profiles revealed enough information for social engineering attacks, and their home WiFi was using outdated security protocols. We provided a clear, non-technical action plan with step-by-step instructions for securing their digital lives. Six months later, the family reports feeling much more confident about their online safety.</p>
